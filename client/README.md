# OTP debug client (next)

This is the next version of the debug client, intended to replace `../src/client`.

It is designed to work with the Transmodel GraphQL API.

## Stack notes

This is a true Single Page Application (SPA) written in TypeScript on the React framework. It uses `vite` to run
(locally) and for building static assets. It requires no server runtime, and can be served from a CDN and run entirely
in the browser.

The design framework is Bootstrap with React support from `react-bootstrap`.

The map framework is MapLibre, using `MapLibre GL JS` with React support from `react-map-gl`.

GraphQL integration is provided by `graphql-request`, with type support added with `@graphql-codegen`. Types are
generated during build and are not checked into the repository.

## Prerequisites

Use latest LTS version of Node/npm (currently v18). Recommend using a version manager such as `nvm`.

The dev and production builds require graphql schema to be present at
`../src/main/resources/org/opentripplanner/apis/transmodel/schema.graphql`.

## Getting started (development)

Change directory to `client` (current) if you haven't already.

    npm install

Then

    npm run dev

The debug client will now be available at `http://localhost:5173/`. It has
hot reloading enabled, so you don't have to restart it when you save files.

If you change graphql code during development you can issue the following command:

    npm run codegen

You don't have to restart the development server for the changes to take effect.

## Build for production

Change directory to `client` (current) if you haven't already.

    npm install

Then

    npm run build

## Which OTP instance do I use?

In development mode, the debug client by default assumes you are running an OTP instance locally at
port 8080 (see `.env.development`). If you wish to point to a different OTP instance
(like a remote server), use the environment variable`VITE_API_URL`, either at the command line,
or add it to a new `.env.development.local` file (this file will be ignored by git).

In production mode, the default is to access OTP via the same origin as the client (see `.env`).
This behavior can also be modified by changing the previously mentioned environment variable at
build-time.
